## Optional folder:

You may create this folder and include a `stopstarter_description.txt` that is used by `stopstarter.py` to update streams it creates, using the file as the livestream description. _(Alternatively: you may update the line in the `create_broadcast` function of `stopstarter.py`, which is the default description when a `script_files/stopstarter_description.txt` is not found.)_
